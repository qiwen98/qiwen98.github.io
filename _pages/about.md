        <p>I was born and raised in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, a city blessed with multicultural food and people. This lovely city is closely developed with its neighbor, Singapore. I am a storyteller, researcher, AR/VR enthusiast. In my day to day routine, I always find myself manipulate image pixels directly from u_int8 buffers.</p>
