About Me
------
I was born in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, a city blessed with multicultural food, people, and society. This lovely city is closely developed with its neighbor, Singapore.
I am a developer, 3D vision researcher, deep learning practitioner, and 3D modeler.

                        We propose a 3D compositional morphable model of eyeglasses that accurately incorporates high-fidelity geometric and photometric interaction effects.<br>
                        We employ a hybrid representation that combines surface geometry and a volumetric representation to enable modification of geometry, lens insertion and frame deformation.<br>
                        Our model is relightable under point lights and natural illumination, which can synthesize casting shadows between faces and glasses.
